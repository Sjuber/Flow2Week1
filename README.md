Basicly, all what was asked for is made and should be working.

Only made one test, since there wasent truly a limit on how many should make. I am sure i could make tests for the other methods, but it was not asked, and this is not work for a company. The program probably works. If it doesent work, please do contact me about it so i can go back and fix it. If not, have a nice and pleasent day :D
